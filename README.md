# Notepad++ custom colors

Custom color schemes, both themes and language definitions, for Notepad++.

I upload here themes and color schemes I love to use with Notepad++, including some definitions for not-so-popular languages I use often (e.g. awk/gawk, dxl).

## Installation

I will make a short guide here, I promise. For now, please google-fu your way and bear patience.

## Currently Supported Themes

Follows list of themes I cover:

- [Material Dark](https://github.com/naderi/material-theme-for-npp): I loved ths theme a lot, here you can find some languages extensions.

- [Cydonia](https://github.com/daemonPainter/npp_custom_colors/tree/master/Cydonia): Customized theme based on vanilla Blackboard npp theme. Comes with several languages extensions.
