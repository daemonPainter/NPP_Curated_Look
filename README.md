# Notepad++ Curated Look

Custom color schemes, both themes and language definitions, for Notepad++.

I upload here themes and color schemes I love to use with Notepad++, including some definitions for not-so-popular languages I use often (full list below)

## Installation

### Installing themes

If in trouble, consult the [official guide](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/nppThemes) on how to install Notepad++ themes.

1. Close Notepad++;
2. Clone this repository locally, or download a copy;
3. Import the file by placing the file in your `themes\` folder
    - For most installations, copy the content of the themes folder to `%APPDATA%\Roaming\Notepad++\themes`
    - If you have multiple users on the same computer, and want the theme available to all users on that machine, put it into `C:\Program Files\Notepad++\themes\` (or `C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\themes for a 32-bit Notepad++`)
    - For portable installations, instead put the themes in the `themes\` sub-folder under the directory where your portable `notepad++.exe` resides
4. Restart Notepad++
5. Select your newly installed theme from Preferences > Style Configurator
