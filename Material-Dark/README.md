# gawk_material_dark
Notepad++ styler for [gawk](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html) to go along the [Material Dark](https://github.com/naderi/material-theme-for-npp) custom theme.

## Installation

From menu -> Language -> Define your language... hit Import... and navigate to this xml file (I suggest you store it in the Notepad++ install folder - even more for a portable version). Import it and restart Notepad++. From the same menu -> Language select gawk from the very bottom of the dropdown list.

Enjoy!

## Notes

This styler was made to go along the Material Dark theme (link at beginning). It allows you to add shortcuts comments and highlight restricted keywords.
